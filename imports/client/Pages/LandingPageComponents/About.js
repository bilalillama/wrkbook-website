There are currently very few viable methods for contractors to find employees including word of mouth, last minute phone calls, and even gathering workers off the street. In a rapidly evolving world, these methods are quickly becoming obsolete and the need for a platform is critical. WrkBook is here to bridge that technology gap, with the help of co-founders Yuk Kee Chang and Tabahani Hayles. </p>
